# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-the-comments-made-on-NYT-articles
The dataset here comprises of comments made on articles in New York Times in Jan-April 2018 and Jan-April 2017. Here we explore the features of the dataset for March 2018 and in particular study their relationship with the feature recommendations that counts the number of upvotes a comment has received.

We have explored the numerical and categorical features so far using graphs and descriptive statistics. The most central features in the dataset are textual for example the commentBody. The next kernel that is a work in progress will be a starter kernel for model building using the textual data. Meanwhile, the kernel here makes word clouds out of most common words in certain features of the dataset.
